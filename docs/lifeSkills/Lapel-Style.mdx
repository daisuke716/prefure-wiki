## Notched Lapel

The notched lapel (“step collar” in England) is the standard lapel style for business suits and other conservative jackets. Its ubiquity makes it play well with any face shape and body type, though it’s particularly sympathetic to Oval, Oblong, and Square face shapes.   

It also pairs well with Average, Big & Tall, and Short & Thin body types.   

If you’re unsure of either of these things as they relate to you, see our guide to face shapes and / or our body type guide.   

## Peak Lapel

Also known as a “point lapel” in England, peak lapels are the dressiest lapel style.   

Characterized by a closed gorge and a lapel that points upwards towards the shoulder, they’re standard on double-breasted suits, common on tuxedo jackets, and can make a single-breasted suit look more rakish than it would with a simple notched lapel.   

As its defined by angularity, the peak lapel works best on men with rounder facial and body features. Round, Oval, and Heart shaped faces all share some softness that gets tempered by the peaked lapel’s angles, and Short and Heavyset men benefit from the height and slimness the peak lapel offers.

## Shawl Lapel

Shawl lapels (also known as shawl collars) are totally rounded, gorge-less collars wherein the lapel and collar are actually made of one piece. Only found on black tie attire (with a particular commonness on smoking jacket), the shawl collar can be worn with either single or double-breasted jackets.   

Shawl collars are best suited for men who have angular face shapes, such as Square, Triangle, and Diamond. They also tend to work well on Thin and Tall & Thin men, as the roundness of the lapel softens the harsher angles of these faces and body types.
