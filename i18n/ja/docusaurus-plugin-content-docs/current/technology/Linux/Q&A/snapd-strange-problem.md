# Resolving the Issue with Hugo `hugo new site` in Snap Environment

When using Hugo to build static websites, I encountered an issue: while trying to create a new site using the Snap-installed version of Hugo with the command `hugo new site`, the files were not created in the current directory as expected. Instead, they were placed in `/var/lib/snapd/void`.

After investigation, I found that this was caused by Snap's sandboxing mechanism, which interferes with Hugo's ability to correctly access the local directory. Here is a detailed analysis of the issue and how to resolve it.

---

## The Problem

Running the following command in a target directory (e.g., `/www/wwwroot/prefure-nav`):

```bash
hugo new site .
```

The command outputs a success message, but upon inspection, the target directory contains no files. Instead, all project files are created in `/var/lib/snapd/void`.

---

## Analysis of the Cause

This happens because the Snap-installed version of Hugo operates in a sandboxed environment, which restricts access to certain parts of the file system.

### Specific Causes:
1. **Snap's Sandboxing Mechanism:**
   Snap's sandboxing isolates applications from the system. If the target directory is outside the paths accessible to Snap, Hugo redirects file operations to `/var/lib/snapd/void`, a virtual path used by Snap.

2. **Unconnected `home` Interface:**
   Even for directories within the user's home folder, Hugo cannot access them unless the `home` interface is explicitly connected.

3. **Non-Home Directories:**
   If the target directory (e.g., `/www/wwwroot/`) lies outside Snap's default accessible paths, Snap maps the writes to `/var/lib/snapd/void`.

## Solutions

### Method 1: Connect Snap's `home` Interface

Snap restricts access to the home directory by default. You can grant Hugo permission to access your home directory with the following command:

```bash
sudo snap connect hugo:home
```

This allows Hugo to access your home directory and its subdirectories. If your target path is within the home directory (e.g., `~/my-hugo-site`), this should resolve the issue.

### Method 2: Install Hugo in `--classic` Mode

Snap provides a classic confinement option that removes the sandboxing restrictions and grants the application full access to the file system.

#### Uninstall the current Hugo:
```bash
sudo snap remove hugo
```

#### Install Hugo in classic mode:
```bash
sudo snap install hugo --classic
```

This version of Hugo will not be restricted by Snap's sandbox, allowing it to operate normally in any directory.

### Method 3: Install Hugo from the Official Binary

If you prefer not to use Snap, you can install Hugo using its official binary release:

#### Download Hugo Binary
Visit [Hugo Releases](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases) and download the appropriate version for your system architecture. For example:

```bash
wget https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/download/vX.X.X/hugo_extended_X.X.X_Linux-64bit.tar.gz
```

#### Extract and Install
```bash
tar -xvzf hugo_extended_X.X.X_Linux-64bit.tar.gz
sudo mv hugo /usr/local/bin/
```

#### Verify Installation
```bash
hugo version
```

### Method 4: Explicitly Specify the Target Path

If you must use a non-home directory (e.g., `/www/wwwroot/`), explicitly specify the full path:

```bash
hugo new site /www/wwwroot/prefure-nav
```

This avoids Snap's path mapping issues, but ensure the directory has the correct write permissions.

---

## Conclusion

The Snap-installed version of Hugo can encounter path limitations due to Snap's sandboxing. To resolve this, you can:
1. Use `sudo snap connect hugo:home` to grant access to the home directory.
2. Reinstall Hugo in classic mode: `sudo snap install hugo --classic`.
3. Use Hugo's official binary release to bypass Snap entirely.
4. Explicitly specify the full target path and ensure proper permissions.

In my case, I chose to uninstall Snapd and install Hugo by binary file, which resolved the path mapping issue and allowed me to create projects normally.
